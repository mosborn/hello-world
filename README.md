# hello-world
Matthew Osborn's introduction

Hello, I'm a longtime Java and Groovy developer with plenty of .NET and sysadmin experience. I cut my teeth on PowerBuilder and VisualBasic, installed and administered Sybase, Oracle RAC, and SQL Server. I spent a couple years modernizing a large FoxPro project, and have established BusinessObjects for two different employers.

For the last several years, though, my specialty is Pega BPM programming in close collaboration with TM1 and Cognos BI developers. For quick enterprise scale results solving real business problems, Pega is hard to beat!
